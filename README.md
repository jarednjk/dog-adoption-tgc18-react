# Adogpt

The live demo of the React frontend web application can be accessed [here](https://adogpt.netlify.app/).

The backend API implementation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/jarednjk/dog-adoption-tgc18-express).

## Project Summary

### Project Context

Adogpt is a mobile responsive web application that allows users to rehome or adopt a dog by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

For dog owners who wish to rehome their dogs, they can create, update and delete a dog profile. For new dog owners, they can read and get information of the dog adoption listings.

It is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack.

### Target Audience

It is targetd mainly at individual dog owners who wish to rehome their dogs or potential dog owners who are looking at adoption over buying.

Organisations usually already have their own dog adoption websites, but they are more than welcome to list with us to get more outreach.

### Justification for the App

Current dog owners might put their pet up for adoption for certain reasons such as anxiety issues, aggression issues, and housebreaking issues. 

Future dog owners may prefer adopting from a dog owner over an organisation. Firstly, there is no adoption fee involved. Secondly, it is easier to find a well-trained pedigree breed from a dog owner than an organization like SPCA where most of the dogs are stray or abused. 

I noticed that certain pet adoption websites are too complicated and make it difficult for users to navigate. Thus, I have made this web application easy for users to gather important information on the dogs available for adoption. They can filter criterias like HDB-approved and hypoallergenic etc.
