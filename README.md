## Project Summary

### Project Context

Adogpt is a mobile responsive web application that allows users to rehome or adopt a dog. For dog owners who wish to rehome their dogs, they can create, update and delete a dog profile. For new dog owners, they can read and get information of the dog adoption listings. It is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack.

### Target Audience

It is targeted mainly at individual dog owners who wish to rehome their dogs as well as new dog owners who are looking at adoption over buying. Organisations usually already have their own dog adoption websites, but they are more than welcome to list with us to get more outreach.

### Justification for the App



Strategy

User of my website are people are generally dog lovers who are either current dog owners or future dog owners. Current dog owners might put their pet up for adoption for certain reasons. Future dog owners may prefer to adopt instead of buy as there is no upfront cost to buy them as well as other reasons. However, they also want important information to see if the dog is healthy and a good fit for their criterias.

My users may not be able to find all the critical information such as hdb approved, hypoallergenic, and health status. I also noticed that certain pet adoption websites are too complicated, making it difficult for the users to navigate to browse the dogs available for adoption.
